Goal: To implement a simple reflex agent for the vacuum environment in Exercise 2.8 (Page 63 textbook). 
Run the environment with this agent for all possible initial dirt configuration and agent locations. 
Record the performance score for each configuration and the overall average score based on your design. 
Remember the concept of agent and environment (Figure 2.1 below) we just discussed in chapter 2. 
-------
Implementation:
*GUI
*Random dirt locations
*Random vacuum cleaner agent location
*Start button
*Print score of cleaner (to console)
